# Trigonometry at the unit circle

This is a little web project with Javascript and D3.js where I have animated the definitions of some trogonometric functions at the unit circle.

##Screenshot and a bit of description

The angle in the center is always rounded to 2 decimals. The precision of the calculated trigonometric functions in the upper left corner is 14 decimals (I then truncate the numbers).

An example animation is below:

## Todo

Maybe add an area where the functions can be viewed as a graph and animate the construction of their graphs...
